  How install CRinsta </p> 

LINUX 
      ubuntu: 
  ```
 $ git clone https://github.com/0XIRC/CRinsta.git
  ```
Note that you must have git installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can install it using the following command.
  ```
$ sudo apt install git-all
  ```

  ```
$ cd CRinsta
```
We enter the directory. 
  ```
$ pip install -r requement.txt
  ```
Install the required packages 

  ```
$ python3 instagram.py 
```
After running the script, it will ask you for access to crack! And note that if you choose option 2 in the menu, you must have a password list. If you don't, option 1 is our recommendation. And be sure to enter the password list address in item 2 accurately.

<br> 

**IF USE KALI-LINUX:** 
```
$ pip install -r requement.txt --break-system-packages
```

Option 1: If you choose this option, it will ask you for an ID in the first step! Enter the target ID and the machine will start cracking. 

Option 2: If you choose this option, it will ask you for a victim ID. And in the next step, it will ask for your custom list password address. If you don't have it, it's better to refer to option 1.
